       <p>Here is my short story...</p>
       <br />
       <p>There was once a cowboy that fell in love. She crossed the deserts in solitude, when one day happened upon a town. In this town the cowboy met a young doctor; he was kind, smart, with beautiful brown eyes. The cowboy couldn't help but fall for the young doctor. But alas, the cowboy would be lonely once again. The young doctor was set to leave for a new town, miles and miles away. But the cowboy promised the doctor, "I will always wait, no  matter where the sun takes me." And the cowboy kept her word, waiting till her dying breath under the red sun.
